# users-notes-application

## Solution to the challenge imposed by @blesfia

## API Swagger here: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/afaguilarr/users-notes_application/1.0.0

## Application deployed on heroku: https://users-notes.herokuapp.com/

## I really didn't know how to test the app with Unit tests because every functionality I added was entirely managed by spring so I just ran some API testing sending requests with "[Advanced REST client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo)" an application similar to postman, some print-screens about these API tests are present in the pictures folder.
